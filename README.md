# BeeAppy API
by Makers Academy Remote April 2017
Jessica Barclay, Miles Illsley, Paula Muldoon and Simon Tanner

### About
This Rails API works with the front end React Native/ES6 app [BeeAppy](https://github.com/SimonTanner/Beehave).  Please see the README on that repo for running instructions.

---
## Visit our Heroku site
https://bee-appy.herokuapp.com/bees 
As the Rails backend has no views, you will only be able to see the database of bees.

## Or run locally

Clone the repo. Then:

```bash
bundle install
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### To view in browser
```bash
bin/rails server
```
Then start the server at localhost:3000
